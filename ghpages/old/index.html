      MeePasswords is a simple tool to securely store short snippets of sensible or confidential data such as passwords and the like.<br />
      Currently MeePasswords is available for MeeGo Harmattan and Fremantle (N900). 
      Ports to other systems supported by Qt are considered.<br />
      If you like to get an idea of how it works and what security measures are taken please have a look at the <a href="#Under_the_Hood">Under the Hood</a> section.

      The Fremantle (N900) version can be installed from the Fremantle <a href="http://maemo.org/packages/view/meepasswords">extras-devel</a> repository.<br />
      Since 1.2.0 the Fremantle version does not rely on the experimental Qt versions. 
      Hence, MeePasswords can now also be downloaded from extras-testing and may be promoted to extras if enough people vote for it.
      <br />
      <br />
      The Harmattan / MeeGo version can be installed from the in-official <a href="http://wiki.meego.com/N950_landing_page#Development_Repositories">Harmattan Community Repository</a>.<br />
      <br />
      Alternatively, you can install MeePasswords for Harmattan / MeeGo using the following file:<br />

          <a name="FAQ">FAQ</a>
      </h3>
      <h4>
      Q: &quot;MeePasswords&quot;? What kind of silly name is this?
      </h4>
      <p>
      A: Author's Note: Well choosing a name for some piece of software can be a little cumbersome. 
      The way MeePasswords got it name was a little bit like this: &quot;Hmm, I want some way to store my password on MeeGo... My passwords, MeeGo?.. why not call it MeePasswords?!?&quot;
      That is actually not the full story but gives away the chain of though pretty well.
      </p>
      <h4>
      Q: Ain't there already enough of these apps out there?
      </h4>
      <p>
      A: Yes and no. Yes if you consider other operating systems. 
      No if you look at MeeGo Harmattan. 
      At least the author did not find any versions for MeeGo Harmattan so MeePasswords was created.
      </p>
      <h4>
      Q: Features x, y, and z are missing!
      </h4>
      <p>
      A: The primary goal of MeePasswords is to keep the user interface as simple and intuitive to use as possible.
      Hence, the functionality is (for now?) reduced to the minimum needed to organize passwords and the like.
      Feel free to send your feature requests to the author, though.
      Maybe in some future versions the features you are looking for might be implemented.
      </p>
      <h4>
      Q: So, is it really absolutely secure?
      </h4>
      <p>
      A: Well, there is no such thing as &quot;absolute, 100% security&quot;.
      There are many ways data could be stolen from electronic devices, e.g.:
      cryptographic algorithms can be broken or could be badly implemented, data might be decrypted by brute force, or applications might contain implementation errors that allow access to sensible data (to name just a few).<br />
      If you want to know more about the internals of MeePasswords please have a look at the <a href="#Under_the_Hood">Under the Hood</a> section or at the source code itself.
      Please also note that MeePasswords is &quot;... distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&quot;

            <a name="Under_the_Hood">Under the Hood</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
      MeePasswords uses 256 bit AES encryption in chain block cipher (CBC) mode for encrypting the actual passwords file.
      The access to this file is protected by a user given password.<br />
      Please note that there is no way to recover a lost password.
      So if the password is lost all entries stored in MeePasswords are lost as well.<br />
      For more details please have a look at the MeePasswords source code.<br />
      Due to the lack of a special secured storage the Fremantle version uses just a file that is encrypted via AES256-CBC.
